# DoggoDB™  

Find your furry friend!

## Up and Running

DoggoDB is based on [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and, as such, is fairly easy to get rolling with.  

```bash
gh repo clone jszpila/doggodb   # assuming you have gh cli installed
cd doggodb                      # navigate to repo root
npm i                           # install dependencies
npm start                       # start the project
```

Voilà! You should now be able to use the site, hosted on [http://localhost:3000/doggodb](http://localhost:3000/doggodb), unless your ports are configured differently.

Don't want to go through all that? You can view the project live at [jszpila.github.io/doggodb](https://jszpila.github.io/doggodb)
